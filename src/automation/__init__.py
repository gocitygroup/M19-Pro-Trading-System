"""
Automation package for GSignalX-powered auto-trading.

This package is intentionally self-contained so it can be used by:
- The continuous automation runner script (polling + rule matching)
- The Flask web dashboard (CRUD rules + status + active pairs)
- Existing trading scripts (optional consumption of active pairs)
